## Fiddling around with Covid Data

The repo has to be organized somewhat, however, the purpose of this repo is to organize scripts and saved data that I'm using for analysing Covid19 information.

The scripts will be organized under:

[Article Scripts](https://github.com/maximegalon5/Covid19/tree/master/article_scripts) <- These are the scripts used to make plots and other data manipulation for individuals [blog posts](https://maximegalon5.github.io/Epimethean/).

[Download Scripts](https://github.com/maximegalon5/Covid19/tree/master/download_scripts) <- These are scripts used to download data and parse data scraped from websites. Currently it is data from the [JHU Repo](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) and data from the [Indian Council of Medical Research](https://www.icmr.gov.in/) and India's [Ministry of Health and Family Welfare](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/)

Data is organized as:

[Current Data](https://github.com/maximegalon5/Covid19/tree/master/data) <- WIP

[Backup Data](https://github.com/maximegalon5/Covid19/tree/master/data/backup) <- WIP
