## Fiddling around with Covid Data

The repo has to be organized somewhat, however, the purpose of this repo is to organize scripts and saved data that I'm using for analysing Covid19 information.

The scripts will be organized under /scripts and the data sources under /data.

The scripts are used to generate plots which I'm using for my [blog](https://maximegalon5.github.io/Epimethean/).
